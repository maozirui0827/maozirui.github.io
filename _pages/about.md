# News
Check out our [latest GSMs book](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789811280016_0001) about an adept numerical method tailored for solving challenging engineering problems  characterized by complex geometry and large deformation. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Gradient-Smoothing-Methods-Programming-Applications/dp/9811280002), [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books/about/Gradient_Smoothing_Methods_with_Programm.html?id=BwsD0AEACAAJ), [BARNES & NOBLE](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/gradient-smoothing-methods-with-programming-gui-rong-liu/1143616909?ean=9789811280009), [Harvard Book Store](https://shop.harvard.com/book/9789811280009), and more. Don't forget to explore the [open-source, in-house code](https://github.com/maozirui/GSMs_book) that accompanies the book, providing practical implementation on the presented numerical method.
